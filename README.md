## Steps to Create

1. **Plan Your Content:**
   Outline the sections and content you want to include in your portfolio. Consider what makes you stand out and what you want to highlight.

2. **Design:**
   Create a simple and clean design for your portfolio using design tools like Figma or Adobe XD for prototyping.

3. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   Choose a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and set up a local development environment. Start by creating the basic structure of your HTML file.

4. **Build the Structure:**
   Divide your portfolio into sections/pages (Home, Projects, Skills, etc.) and start building the HTML structure. Use CSS to style the elements. Use JavaScript to make it responsive and/or PHP to process form inputs from the contact information section/page.

5. **Add Interactivity:**
   Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your portfolio. This could include smooth scrolling, image sliders, or any other interactive elements you'd like to incorporate, animations, transitions, or dynamic content loading.

6. **Make it Responsive:**
   Ensure that your portfolio is responsive. Test it on different devices and use media queries in your CSS to adjust the layout based on screen size.
